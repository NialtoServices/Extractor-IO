## Extractor IO
A simple plugin for WordPress that allows you to extract data from web pages and convert them into posts.

This plugin currently only works with Extractors.

## Installation
Download the latest version of the plugin from [GitHub](https://github.com/NialtoServices/Extractor-IO/archive/master.zip).

Then upload the plugin to your WordPress site by going to: `Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin`

(We're working on adding the plugin to WordPress's plugins repository)

## Setup
Go to the plugin settings: `Extractor IO -> Settings`

Enter your `API Key` which you can get from your [Import IO](https://import.io) account settings page.

You should now see a list of connectors at the bottom of the page.

Click the `Edit Mapping` link next to the connector you want to setup.

Now just define where your fields should be imported to!

## Extract
All you need to do now is go to the `Extractor IO` page, wack in your URL, click the `Extract Data` button and voila!

Your data will be converted into a WordPress post!

Happy Extracting :)
